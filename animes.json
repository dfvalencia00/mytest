They exist without any goals or purposes aside from simply \"being.\" They are beyond the shackles of the words \"good\" and \"evil.\" Mushi can exist in countless forms and are capable of mimicking things from the natural world such as plants, diseases, and even phenomena like rainbows.\n\nThis is, however, just a vague definition of these entities that inhabit the vibrant world of Mushishi, as to even call them a form of life would be an oversimplification. Detailed information on Mushi is scarce because the majority of humans are unaware of their existence.\n\nSo what are Mushi and why do they exist? This is the question that a \"Mushishi,\" Ginko, ponders constantly. Mushishi are those who research Mushi in hopes of understanding their place in the world's hierarchy of life.\n\nGinko chases rumors of occurrences that could be tied to Mushi, all for the sake of finding an answer.\n\nIt could, after all, lead to the meaning of life itself.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Mushishi Zoku Shou continues the story of Mushishi Ginko on his journey to help the visible world to coexist with the Mushi.\n\nDuring his travels, Ginko discovers various gifted individuals\u2014those cursed by circumstance and those maintaining a fragile symbiosis with the Mushi\u2014inevitably confronting the question of whether humanity, talented and tortured alike, can manage the responsibility of the unseen.

Time loops, living shadows, and telepathy are among the overt effects of interference from Mushi, but more subtle symptoms that take years to be noticed also rouse Ginko's concern as he passes from village to village.\n\nThrough circumstance, Ginko has become an arbiter, determining which Mushi are blessings and which are curses. But the lines that he seeks to draw are subjective. Some of his patients would rather exercise their new powers until they are utterly consumed by them; others desperately strive to rid themselves of afflictions which are in fact protecting their lives from devastation. Those who cross paths with Mushi must learn to accept seemingly impossible consequences for their actions, and heal wounds they did not know they had. Otherwise, they risk meeting with fates beyond their comprehension.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "A rumor spreads among young people that if a person gets on \"that\" train, he/she will disappear.... Most of them don't believe it, but it exists.... It's called Michishio. Michishio was invented to train young girls and make them sex slaves. At first sight, the train is completely the same as a normal train. However, it shows its true self once in a few months. The girls who get on the train are severely trained and become sex slaves.... Seiji is a train conductor. He can do whatever he wants to the girls on the train since he has a special training ability. And another Michishio now departs....\n\n(Source: HimeyaShop)",
